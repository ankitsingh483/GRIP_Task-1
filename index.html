    <h3>ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
    <p>My name is Ankit Kumar Singh.I am 20 years old.I completed my schooling from Kolkata and pursuing my graduation in B.Tech CSE from Techno India University, Kolkata.
       I love to play cricket,watching movies,listening music,reading books and travelling.I want to become a web developer in my life because nowadays web developer is a very interesting course in which i found my way.
       I am a positive and self-believe person too.I am a big fan of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and i want to meet him.I also love to do swimming,bike riding and playing computer games.
       My favourite movie is MSD-THE UNTOLD STORY.I used to wake up early and go to bed early.I love doing exercises as well as some weight lifting in gym corner.
       I feel that what we love to do we have to select that only as our future work.We dont need to waste our time in selecting our dream what we have to become in our life.
